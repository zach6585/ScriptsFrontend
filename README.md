Whole project:

    - COMMENTS!
        
    - I've been really stupid and have only been looking at an iPad Pro!! I need to make sure it works for regular iPad too. Honestly I really should just be making multiple versions depending on size (Like I did with Freshlayers). It will make it longer but it will be much better...

    - There are parts where she wants links to other pages... If I did it with routes this wouldn't have been a problem but now it is since I can't just "link"... Will probably need redux for this unfortunately... Guess I'll implement this last :( Seen on page 5 of script 7 for example 
    
    - Make sure scroll up is always in components

    - Update all files with textboxes to use redux

    - See why X and Check are taking so long to render


= Save a value in db that's associated with the last page that user was on so that when they reload it goes back to that page, especially so they don't have to keep going back to page 1 now that this is a single page app.
    == The way to do this would have a "saved page" quality in the users table
    == Would have a "return to beginning" option on the last page
= Need to get rid of 'here' print statements lol
= Need to make sure that all binding prys are gone
= Need to learn how to clean out postgres so I can gut it of all of the past things I've made but decided not to use like pages and usertexts



Questions for Alice: 

General questions:

    -If it says things like "Will insert hyperlink," is that something that's supposed to be a textbox or is it something that you'll give to me to put in later? (Very clearly yes)
    - For the text over the text boxes in the body image, should it be a placeholder or a physical piece of text that doesn't leave (If it's the second placing it might be difficult since it would be over the written text)
    (Answer: Make it stay (just have the text start below it))
    - How secure do you want it to be? Like do you want password authentication? This would require an email in case they forget their password, someone hacks in, etc. 
    (Answer: Some barebones minimum security)
    - There are a decent amount of typos... Should I run through this and try and fix them? 
    (Answer: Sure)
    - Will mentors have multiple mentees and vice versa?
    (Answer: Mentors will have multiple mentees but not the other way around)


Script 6:
    Page 6 Step 2: The first text box says "(coping strategy they chose last week)." Does this mean that it should be prefilled in or is it no different than the other text boxes?
    (Answer: Yes it's just a textbox like normal)

    Page 6 Step 4: The stuff after the first page seems mildly unrelated, but it doesn't have a bold text header. Is that supposed to be combined with step 4 or is it separate? For now I'll put it on the same page.
    (Answer: Yes keep it all )

    Page 8: 
        - What does "The one they picked" mean? There was never a point before where they picked something


Script 7: 
    Page 8 step 4:
        - You have the words "Today we tried [solution]" There's no explanation for what the solution is so I'm not sure what to put there
        (Answer: Just a text box)
Script 8:
    Page 9:
        - What does "The one they picked" mean? There was never a point before where they picked something
    
Scripts 9 & 10:
    Page 6:
        - It says "hyperlink for go to next page." Do you want that alongside the already existing button or do you just want the text?

    Page 8:
        - For the different steps, one some pages you have the title left oriented whereas on others you have it in the center. Which do you want
        -What do you mean by "can we make this work online" for card sort? I don't undestand what card sort is... 

        
    Page 10:
        - What does "The one they picked" mean? There was never a point before where they picked something

Script 11:
    Page 5: Does [Skip to ...] mean you want this to be a button? 
    Page 8:
        - You have a textbox with the words "Share your example of when you have asked for support. " in it. Would you like it to be the kind of thing that once you start typing it goes away? That's probably how I would do it so that's how I'm going to keep it in
        - Does "Link: Able to insert this" mean that it should be a textbox?

Notes from meeting on 1/12/22

- Make body form a separate thing that is linked to. You click it and you go to the page with the body form that's the full size of the page.

- Get rid of drop down and just make the "page 8 steps" be separate pages 

- Get cost of deployment and deploy so people can access it

- Work on being able to change it in real time asap so that Ariel can do that

- Make most text boxes higher as scrolling will make things hard.
